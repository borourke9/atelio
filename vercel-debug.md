# Vercel Deployment Debug Guide

## ✅ Current Status
- **Local Build**: ✅ Working (TypeScript errors fixed)
- **Git Commits**: ✅ All changes committed and pushed
- **Repositories**: ✅ Both `atelio` and `design` updated

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Vercel Project Settings
- Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Find your project
- **Settings → General**
- **Root Directory**: Should be `frontend`
- **Build Command**: Should be `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: Should be `dist`

### 2. Check Git Repository
- **Settings → Git**
- Make sure it's connected to: `borourke9/atelio`
- **Branch**: Should be `main`

### 3. Force Redeploy
- Go to **Deployments** tab
- Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
- Or create a **new deployment** from the latest commit

### 4. Check Build Logs
- Look for TypeScript errors in the build logs
- Should see: `✓ built in X.XXs` (success)
- Should NOT see: `error TS6133` or similar

### 5. Alternative: Create New Project
If the above doesn't work:
1. **Delete** the current Vercel project
2. **Create new project** from `borourke9/atelio`
3. **Set Root Directory** to `frontend`
4. **Deploy**

## 🎯 Expected Result
After successful deployment, you should see:
- ✨ **ATELIO.AI** branding (not "Home Canvas")
- 🎨 **Premium frosted-glass UI**
- 🛋️ **Working product catalog**
- 🎯 **Click-to-place functionality**

## 📞 If Still Not Working
The issue might be:
1. **Vercel caching** - Try creating a new project
2. **Wrong repository** - Make sure it's `borourke9/atelio`
3. **Wrong branch** - Make sure it's `main`
4. **Build settings** - Make sure Root Directory is `frontend`
